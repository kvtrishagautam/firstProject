    <h3>Is One direction worth the hype?</h3>
    <p>Yes. It is. As seen from my point of view, it's an amazing band who is filled with talented people and never lose a chance to entertain their their fans.

        Music- as seen from the music point of view, their music is really different from others. Their songs have the feel and the depth which is required. All of them are really talented and never fail to impress us by their skills. Others say that their songs have no meaning, I'm sure they haven't heard “They don't know about us”, “Ready to Run”, “Strong”, “Through the dark” and many others which are underrated (I don't believe how), but are really meaningful.
        
        Individuals - as an individual being, the band members are really humorous and generous. They are great friends and support each other. Well might be today they are not as supportive to each other as they were(I'm sure they still miss their fellow band mates), but they'll definitely get back together soon.
        
        So, One Direction is a perfect band.</p>
